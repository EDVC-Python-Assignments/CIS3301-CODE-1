## CIS3301-CODE-1: The guessing game

In your first coding assignment, you will create a simple guessing game. In this game, the user will try to guess the outcome of a regular virtual dice (6 faces). To receive full credit if your code accomplishes all the following requirements:

- Request the user their guess about the outcome of a regular dice
  - Use the following prompt: "Enter your guess:"
- Roll the dice and output the result of the dice to the user
  - Use the following output prompts
    - Before rolling the dice: "Rolling the dice..."
    - After rolling the dice: "The dice shows x" (replace "x" with the outcome of the dice)
- Tell the user if their guess was right or not.
  - Use the following output prompts 
    - Correct guess: "Hooray! Your guess (x) was right." (replace "x" with the guess number)
    - Incorrect guess: "Sorry. Your guess (x) was wrong." (replace "x" with the guess number)
 
  
Make sure you code your assignment in the file "code_1.py". You will find some code already done in this Python script. Complete the rest of the code to the best of your abilities.
